## Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my personal collection of data structures and algorithm implementations. As a self-taught programmer, I am constantly learning and improving my skills, and this repository is a documentation of my journey.

### Data Structures
The following data structures are currently included in this repository:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Hash Tables
* Graphs

Each data structure has its own directory, with its corresponding implementation in a programming language of my choice.

Algorithms
The following algorithms are currently included in this repository:

Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
Graph Algorithms
Breadth-First Search
Depth-First Search
Each algorithm has its own directory, with its corresponding implementation in a programming language of my choice.

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
You can then browse the different data structures and algorithms, and run them on your own machine to see how they work.

Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository, you can fork it and make your changes, then submit a pull request. I welcome all contributions, whether they are bug fixes, new implementations, or even just suggestions for improvements.
