# QUESTION
"""
Write a function that returns the intersection of two arrays. The intersection is a third array that contains all values contained within the first two
arrays. For example, the intersection of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] is [2, 4].
Your function should have a complexity of O(N). (If your programming
language has a built-in way of doing this, donâ€™t use it. The idea is to build
the algorithm yourself.)

# ALGORITHM
"""
inputs => two given arrays( array1, array2)
outputs => intesction array(intesectionArray)

Target :: get compelexity of O(N)
