# QUESTION
"""This problem is known as the “Unique Paths” problem: Let’s say you have
a grid of rows and columns. Write a function that accepts a number of rows
and a number of columns, and calculates the number of possible “shortest”
paths from the upper-leftmost square to the lower-rightmost square.

For example, here’s what the grid looks like with three rows and seven
columns. You want to get from the “S” (Start) to the “F” (Finish).
[S, , , ]
[ , , , ]
[ , , ,F]
By “shortest” path, I mean that at every step, you’re moving either one
step to the right or one step downward
Again, your function should calculate the number of shortest paths.
